Assignment 1:-
Write an ASP.NET function that processes and stores user information using a Dictionary. Each user has a unique UserID (integer) and a UserName (string). Your task is to implement a method that performs the following operations:

AddUser(int userID, string userName): Adds a new user to the Dictionary.
GetUserName(int userID): Retrieves the user name based on the user ID.
RemoveUser(int userID): Removes a user from the Dictionary by their ID.
If the user ID already exists when adding, update the user name. If a user ID is not found during retrieval or removal, handle the scenario gracefully by returning appropriate messages
